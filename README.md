# INF651 — Frontend Development Assignments

This repository contains the assignments and practice work for the INF651 Frontend Development course. Each assignment lives in its own folder and is a small, static frontend project (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The projects are intentionally simple so they can be opened directly in a browser or served with a minimal static server.

## Repository structure

- `assignment2/` — Assignment 2 (open `index.html` in your browser)
- `assignment3/` — Assignment 3 (open `index.html` in your browser)
- `movies-watchlist/` — A small movies watchlist app (open `index.html`)
- `week 2/` — Week 2 exercises and assets

Files of interest:
- Top-level `README.md` (this file)
- Each folder contains an `index.html` plus supporting `scripts/`, `styles/`, and assets.

## How to run

These are static frontend projects; pick whichever works for you:

- Open directly in the browser
  - Double-click the `index.html` file in a folder (works for most simple demos).

- Use VS Code Live Server (recommended during development)
  - Install the Live Server extension, open the folder, and click "Go Live".

- Use a simple static server (PowerShell / cross-platform)
  - From the repo root or inside an assignment folder, run a quick HTTP server.


## Conventions

- Each assignment is self-contained. The entry point is the `index.html` file inside the assignment folder.
- Scripts are usually in `scripts/` or `script.js` at the assignment root.
- Styles are usually in `styles/` or `styles.css`.
